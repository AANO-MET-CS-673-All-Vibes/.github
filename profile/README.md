# allvibes
This is the central organization for allvibes, a music-themed social app that matches people with similar music tastes built for MET CS 673 - Software Engineering. The frontend (web client) and backend (Flask and MySQL) are implemented here.

## Demo
You can access a live demo at [allvibes.jewelcodes.io](https://allvibes.jewelcodes.io) but will likely need to contact one of the team members with the email address used with your Spotify account. This is because we use Spotify for authentication, and Spotify does not allow non-developers to use an app that is in development mode. A request to switch out of development mode also takes several weeks to be reviewed by Spotify, so it'll be easier to simply add to the email allow list.

## Documentation
Most of the code is self-explanatory and self-commenting, but the description of each API endpoint we built is located [under the backend repository](https://github.com/AANO-MET-CS-673-All-Vibes/BackEnd/blob/main/docs/Backend%20API%20Design%20Draft.md). This draft includes details on the parameters passed to and responses returned by API endpoints, as well as sample responses in raw JSON.
